**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Looking back on my previous work, I see opportunities where I could have done more to incorporate both ethics and equity into how we handled data. While we aimed to support vulnerable communities like low-income youth and newcomers, we didn’t always fully consider how our data practices might impact these groups. Ethical concerns like privacy and security are crucial when dealing with sensitive information, but it's also important to reflect on how data systems can unintentionally exclude or misrepresent certain populations. For instance, while we focused heavily on academic outcomes, we didn’t always question whether the data we were collecting was inclusive or if the way we analyzed it might reinforce existing inequalities.

Moving forward, I’d take a more intentional approach by embedding ethical principles such as privacy, consent, and security into every stage of the data process. At the same time, I’d ensure that equity plays a central role by making sure that our data reflects diverse perspectives and doesn’t perpetuate bias. By focusing on both ethics and equity, I can help create a more fair and inclusive approach to my work, ensuring that the data we use serves everyone, especially those who are most often overlooked.
